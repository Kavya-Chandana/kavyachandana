            <h1>Breaking the Mold: How I Found My Confidence in Tech</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Hear out how Kavya broke stereotypes with confidence and courage</p>
            <p>An inspiring story on how a young adult overcame her struggle through her anxious thoughts reminiscing
                about
                her career.</p>

        <br />
        <p>Hey everyone, Kavya here! I'm in my 3rd year of B.Tech, and let me tell you, it's been a wild ride so far. I
            always knew I wanted to be in tech, but sometimes it felt like I didn't quite fit the "mold." You know, the
            image of the stereotypical programmer who's been coding since they were 10 and lives and breathes
            algorithms?
            That was never me.</p>

        <p>For a long time, I let those thoughts define me, until I realized I don't have to be someone to someone, I
            just
            have to be <em>me</em>.</p>

        <h2>The Pressure Cooker</h2>

        <p>Being a woman in tech, especially in a field that's still largely male-dominated, comes with its own set of
            pressures. I constantly felt like I had to prove myself, work twice as hard, and always be on top of my
            game. It
            was exhausting! Then the overthinking would kick in:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>Am I smart enough?</em></li>
            <li><em>Do I belong here?</em></li>
            <li><em>Am I ever going to be taken seriously?</em></li>
            <li><em>Can I really become a great software engineer with this skill set that i am having?</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Those thoughts would leave me paralyzed with fear.</p>

        <h2>Redefining Success</h2>

        <p>The turning point for me was realizing that success isn't about fitting into a mold or meeting someone else's
            expectations. It's about defining your own path, embracing your unique strengths, and pursuing what
            genuinely
            excites you. It's like playing a video game, but you define what victory is.</p>

        <h2>My Secret Weapons</h2>

        <p>These are different weapons I've made to make this world better.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Embrace My Strengths:</strong> I realized that I didn't have to be a coding whiz to be valuable
                in
                tech. I was able to be more empathetic than some of the people with great technical skills, making me a
                great team worker and more importantly a team leader.</li>
            <li><strong>Find My Tribe:</strong> Surrounding myself with other supportive and like-minded individuals
                made a
                world of difference. I also realized that everyone felt the same at some point of time, making me
                realize
                these pressures were there just for a very short time to pass. And to be the best, you need to fail at
                it.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Challenge the Status Quo:</strong> I started speaking up and advocating for more diversity and
                inclusion in tech. I joined organizations that support women and underrepresented groups in STEM, and I
                used
                my voice to challenge stereotypes and promote equality.</li>
            <li><strong>Knowing when to stop:</strong> Its just that my anxiety comes from my career but its not that
                serious that its making me really depressed or anything. I know my goals and everything, and my actions
                are
                always driven towards it. I know if I am going the right way or not, and even it is not, it is fine,
                because
                I will find something along the way. And I cannot keep going forever. We all need to switch to youtube
                at
                some point of time.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>My Takeaway</h2>

        <p>Breaking stereotypes and conquering career anxieties takes courage, confidence, and a willingness to embrace
            your
            unique self. Don't be afraid to challenge the status quo, find your tribe, and define success on your own
            terms.
            You've got this! âœ¨</p>
